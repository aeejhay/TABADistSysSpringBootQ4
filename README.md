# Smart Device RESTful API

This project implements a **Spring Boot REST API** to simulate controlling smart devices in a home or IoT environment. It allows users to turn devices on/off, check their status, and update their settings.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

* List all devices
* Turn a device **ON** or **OFF**
* Check the **status** of a device
* Update device **settings** (key-value pairs)

## ðŸ§ª Test Using Postman

### Turn ON device `101`

```
PUT http://localhost:8080/devices/101/on
```

Response:

```
"Device 101 is now ON"
```

### Turn OFF device `101`

```
PUT http://localhost:8080/devices/101/off
```

### Check device status

```
GET http://localhost:8080/devices/101
```

### Update settings

```
PUT http://localhost:8080/devices/101/settings
Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
